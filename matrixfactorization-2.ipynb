**Matrix factorization**\n","The selected method based on matrix factorization is  singular value decomposition (SVD). It's been choosen based on the current resources and dataset. SVDpp which is notoriusly better than SVD has been took into consideration and run but our computational resources weren't enough to run it in a acceptable time and an acceptable amount of data.\n","The Hyperparameters of SVD are number of epochs, number of factors, learning rate and regularization term. For this assignment we considered changing all of these parameters using GridSearch with 5-fold cross validation. After running we saw that the default current value of 0.005 was the best performing. The hyperparameters optimized that we decided to tune for SVD are: number of epochs and factors and the regularization term:\n","\n","\n","*   **Epochs**: It is the number of iteration of the SGD (stochastic gradient descent) procedure. We tried values between 10 and 120 the optimal number for our model it's 100, 120 perfomed better but in the order of millesimal.\n","*   **Factors**: It is used to determine the number of factors to extract/retain during teh singular value decomposition, the default value is 100. We tried values between 50 and 200, the one with the lowest RMSE was 150.\n","*   **Regularization**: It is used to fit the model appropriately and avoid overfitting. We tried values between 0.5 and 0.02. The best performing regularization term for us was 0.01.\n","\n","In total with parameters tuning thanks to GridSearch and 5-fold cross validation we achieved a **RMSE** of **0.7955**. Besides comparing it with the Normal predictor we decided to compare it with a baseline SVD with a train-test split of 25% which performed RMSE of 0.8150 and another baseline SVD this time with a 5-fold cross validation which performed a RMSE of 0.8090.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m5cA0Llvphtj"},"source":["We decided for lack of resources and run the algorithm in a reasonable time to cut the database to the top 100 movies.
